        "While this website is mainly about scRNA-seq, a major drawback of scRNA-seq is that the tissue needs to be dissociated into single cells prior to transcriptome profiling, thus losing spatial contexts of the cells which are often biologically relevant. Spatial transcriptomics aims to profile the transcriptome while preserving the spatial information about the cells. The field of spatial transcriptomics has seen tremendous growth since 2015. \n",

        "In principle, kallisto bustools can be used for any sequencing based spatial transcriptomics method that stores spatial barcodes, UMIs, and reads in fastq files, including not only Visium, but also [Spatial Transcriptomics](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6294/78) (ST, the forerunner of Visium) and [DBiT-seq](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.026). \n",
        "\n",
        "However, note that not all of the Space Ranger functionalities can be achieved with kallisto bustools, as Space Ranger has image processing functionalities to detect Visium fiducials and align the transcript spots to the H&E image, which kallisto bustools cannot do. Therefore, while we use kallisto bustools to process the Visium fastq files, at present, we need to use the spot coordinates as in the aligned H&E image from Space Ranger to get the H&E image to display properly in `Seurat` and `SpatialExperiment`. Nevertheless, kallisto bustools is valuable for analyzing Visium data, as it can be used to relatively quickly generate spliced and unspliced matrices for RNA velocity analysis and can be used to generate a transcript compatibility count (TCC) matrix which retains some isoform information.\n",

        "Here we analyze a Visium dataset of a chicken heart at embryonic day 14 (D14), or Hamburger-Hamilton stage 40, when the 4 chambers have formed. Chicken is commonly used to study heart development, because of the similarities between avian and mammalian hearts, and because the chicken embryo can be cultured in vitro to facilitate observation. This dataset is from this publication:\n",

        "In this tutorial, we will begin with processing the fastq files and removing empty spots. Once we get the filtered gene count matrix, we will compare the kallisto bustools results with Space Ranger results, and then walk you through some concepts in spatial statistics and common types of data analyses in spatial transcriptomics, compared to their non-spatial counterparts in the standard scRNA-seq workflow which is commonly used in the spatial transcriptomics literature. We will demonstrate usage of some R packages for those spatial transcriptomics analyses and link to other relevant packages, whether written specifically for spatial transcriptomics or for spatial statistics in general. \n",

There's an R package that can correct for transcript diffusion in Visium, [SpotClean](https://github.com/zijianni/SpotClean). Moreover, there appears to be spatial autocorrelation in total counts, which seems to be related to biological regions (e.g. higher total counts at the valves), so I doubt if total counts should be corrected for as a technical artefact as in some scRNA-seq data normalization methods using size factors.

Technical variation that is spatially relevant would occur on the slide. A potential source of such technical variation may be amount of barcodes, UMIs, and capture sequences printed on each spot. I don't know how Visium spots are printed, but most likely they are printed row by row or column by column, and if so, spatial autocorrelation of amount of barcodes printed would be along the rows or columns rather than in both x and y directions as seen here for total counts. Another potential source of spatial technical variation is fluid handling during reverse transcription and second strand synthesis on the slide; exploring spatial autocorrelation in empty spots across datasets may shed some light on this.

These two R packages date back to the early 2000s, well before the advent of Tidyverse. In fact, `gstat` is about as old as R itself, started in 1993 as an S package and went on CRAN in 2003. These old package use `sp`, which is the forerunner of Tidyverse `sf`. So we begin with constructing a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` from `sp` with the spot coordinates and variables whose spatial autocorrelation to explore. Here we mainly show spatial autocorrelation of total counts per spot, but such analyses can be done to any spot level metadata or gene. It's infeasible to manually inspect these plots for all 20,000 genes, but as we shall see later in this tutorial, some methods to find spatially variable genes rely on spatial autocorrelation.\n"

However, in kriging, a more relaxed kind of stationarity is used -- instead of the covariance, the variance of differences between lagged spots, i.e. the (semi)variogram, only depends on distance between the spots. The (semi)variogram is defined as:\n",

        "Kriging requires fitting a parametric variogram model to the data. However, how relevant is kriging to spatial transcriptomics? Perhaps it is relevant to laser capture microdissection (LCM) and GeoMX DSP data where the transcriptome is only profiled at a few select locations in tissue. In Visium, the spots already cover a regular grid in tissue, though there's some spacing between spots. Shall we interpolate gene expression between spots? Also, would Kriging help with refining resolution of Visium? How would that compare to existing methods that increase resolution of Visium, such as `BayesSpace`, and a number of deep learning methods informed by the H&E image? These are open questions that warrant new projects and cannot be addressed within this tutorial. Kriging is used in the R package `spatialGE` to interpolate cell type deconvolution scores in the melanoma ST dataset.\n",

        "Whether Kriging is relevant to spatial transcriptomics or not, the variogram can be used for ESDA. A classic R package for fitting variogram models and spatial and spatiotemporal Kriging is `gstat`, which provides many different variogram models. To make fitting variograms easier, we use the package `automap`, which essentially wraps `gstat` but chooses the best fitting variogram model for us."

        "The variogram model fitted is [M. Stein's parameterization of Matern (`Ste`)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706105000911). The points are the distance bins chosen by `gstat`, and the numbers at the points are number of pairs of points in the distance bin used to estimate the variogram. The nugget is the value of the variogram when distance is 0, which can be measurement error or spatial variability below the spatial resolution of the measurement. Here the semi-variance (see definition of the variogram above) is lower when the distance is small -- spatial autocorrelation, and the semi-variance rises until it levels off as spatial influence only has a certain finite range. The value of semi-variance where the variogram levels off is the sill, and the sill minus nugget is the partial sill. The range is the distance it takes for the variogram to level off. Kappa is a smoothness parameter of Matern class models. \n",

Here the total counts are scaled down by 1000, so the actual semi-variance should be scaled up by 1 million on the plot. The range seems consistent with the deminishing Moran's I shown earlier in the correlogram. In the correlogram, spatial autocorrelation deminishes at around 5 spots out, which is about 400 to 500 microns when spots are 80 something microns apart, and this is where the variogram gets more level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Above, the variogram is isotropic, i.e. it assumes that spatial autocorrelation is the same in all directions. However, this is not necessarily the case. For example, in the cortex layers, gene expression varies more across different layers than within the same layer. This is anisotropy, where spatial autocorrelation differs in different direction. In `gstat`, the variogram can be plotted at different directions (`alpha` argument in `gstat::variogram()`), or as a map in 2D showing a grid of lags in x and y, in a variogram map, `map = TRUE`. This way we can explore anisotropy in spatial autocorrelation."

But more importantly, this section introduces concepts about spatial autocorrelation that can be applied to all genes and spot level metadata.

While the Louvain clusters may delineate spatial regions in the tissue, such as the atria, the valves, and the right ventricle, sometimes spots of the same cluster are more spread out through the tissue and do not delineate a spatial region. Spatial regions can mean different cell types, in which case the transcriptome encodes spatial regions in some ways. PC1, which explains the most variance among the PCs, separates the valves from the other cells, and PC2 separates the atria from the other cells.\n",

        "There are spatially informed dimension reduction methods, such as [geographically weighted PCA (GWPCA)](https://github.com/harvid50/GWPCA_Workshops/blob/master/GWPCA_IJGIS_preprint.pdf), in which PCA is performed at each location with its neighbors as defined by spatial weights. Each location would have a separate set of PCs, which can inform us of which variables are contributing the most to local variances around each location. Visualization is challenging even with only a few variables, and is much more so for spatial transcriptomics. There are other forms of spatially informed PCA, such as [sPCA](https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/raw/master/tutorials/tutorial-spca.pdf), which is a fusion of PCA and Moran's I and returns large positive eigenvalues that indicate positive spatial autocorrelation and large negative eigenvalues that indicate negative spatial autocorrelation. See [this paper](https://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/5850/1/CB_Analysis%20on%20Spatial%20Data.pdf) for more info on different types of spatial PCA applied to fields like geography and ecology, but not yet to spatial transcriptomics.\n",

        "There are also a number of methods for spatially informed clustering for spatial transcriptomics, i.e. using transcriptomes to delineate anatomical regions in the tissue that might not be apparent from H&E tissue morphology. These methods often involve a Markov random field that favors the same cluster label for neighboring spots, so cluster assignment is spatially contiguous. `BayesSpace` is one of these methods, which we use in this tutorial because its principles are reasonable and it's easy to use and easy to install from Bioconductor. As there is yet a 3rd party comprehensive benchmark for spatial clustering methods in spatial transcriptomics, using `BayesSpace` here does not mean endorsing it as best practive. Here's the reference for `BayesSpace`:\n",

        "Such spatial neighborhoods are not entirely the same as non-spatial clustering based on the transcriptome; they are different aspects of the tissue. Here's a geographical analogy: While it's fair to characterize Westwood, especially the part north of Wilshire Blvd, as the UCLA college town, and indeed many UCLA students live there and students do contribute to the ethos there, not everyone who lives in Westwood is a UCLA student, nor does every UCLA student live in Westwood. Non-students, such as restaurant staff and bus drivers, contribute to the unique ethos of the college town as well. The UCLA college town is a spatial region, and the UCLA students, as a demographic group, is analogous to a cell type.\n",

From Louvain clustering, 9 clusters seems reasonable, so we try a range around 9. The argument `d` is the number of top PCs to use. `BayesSpace` runs Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for fit its model, and in `qTune()`, the chain is run for fewer number of steps to get a tentative sense of different number of clusters before running the chain for a greater number of iterations to actually fit the model."

A geographic analogy is that Southern California (So-Cal) is a coarser scale region of California, and indeed Los Angeles (LA), Orange County, and San Diego have much in common in terms of climate and culture that set them apart from the Bay Area. However, LA itself can be partitioned into finer regions based on local ethos, climate, and socioeconomic class, such as Downtown LA, Koreatown, Eastside, Westside, and etc., each of which can be further partitioned, e.g. Westwood is part of Westside. Then merely finding So-Cal definitely misses a lot of information. Which scale of partition to find depends on the questions asked. An analyst of nation scaled data might only need So-Cal or LA county, while a tourist visiting LA would need the finer partitions. Another question here is whether merely subsetting the `SpatialExperiment` object for finer scale clustering is indeed sufficient, because regions adjacent to the region for which a more refined analysis is performed can still be relevant, because both in the tissue and in the city, spatially adjacent regions do influence each other. Furthermore, there may be more than one way to characterize the tissue by spatial regions, while the spatial region methods only assign one label to each spot.\n",

Then many SVGs are really about spatial locations of cell types and cell types can be captured by non-spatial clustering anyway. Then I wonder how much more information identifying SVGs with tools designed for this purpose adds to non-spatial DE. This might depend on the tissue, and in some tissues, such as already seen in the heart, and in the brain cortex and the intestine villi, presence of certain cell types depends on spatial location because these cell types need to be where they are for the tissues for function properly. A more interesting question is whether a gene's expression depends on spatial locations even within a cell type. However, this leads to the question of what we really mean by \"cell type\".\n",

A non-student living in Westwood would have a very good chance to interact with UCLA students, take walks in the UCLA campus, and get influenced by the ethos emergent from not only students but also things like restaurants that students like. So being in Westwood influences traits of people living in Westwood even if they are not UCLA students. Would something similar happen in the tissue? Perhaps; the `Giotto` package can perform DE depending on proximity to another cell type. However, the problem with cell type is that Visium does not have single cell resolution and spots are very likely a mixture of different cell types."

        "A problem with clustering is that sometimes the very notion of discrete cell types is problematic. There may be a continuum of cell states that would not yield to the discrete pigeon holes. Similarly, there may be a continuum of spatial regions, which is observed in geographical space as community ethos often changes gradually in space, which causes disputes in how boundaries between neighborhoods should be defined. DE methods that don't rely on clustering have been developed in both scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics. In spatial transcriptomics, Gaussian process regression, with generalized generalized versions for Poisson or negative binomial data, is a common principle underlying the SVG methods. A gene is deemed a SVG if the model involving the Gaussian process to model spatial autocorrelation fits the data for the gene better than a model with only the linear covariates without the Gaussian process. SPARK is one of these Gaussian process regression based methods. Here's the reference of SPARK:\n",

        "Visium does not have single cell resolution. Suppose a cell is about 10 $\\mu$m across on average, then several cells can fit into one Visium spot, whose diameter is 55 $\\mu$m. For this dataset, as we only have the low resolution H&E image that does not show the nuclei clearly, we don't know the actual number of cells per spot. Many computational methods have been developed to estimate the proportion of cell types -- i.e. deconvolve the cell types -- in each Visium spot, by combining the non-single cell spatial data with scRNA-seq. Some were originally developed for bulk RNA-seq data, while some were designed for array based spatial transcriptomics techniques that don't have single cell resolution such as ST, Visium, and slide-seq. Some papers (including the paper where this dataset comes from) used Seurat to transfer cell type labels from scRNA-seq to Visium and used the transfer score of each cell type as a proxy to cell type proportions in each spot. Some methods specifically designed for cell type deconvolution use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) where the factors stand for cell types and use non-negative least squares to assign cell types to spots. Some methods explicitly model the observed gene counts at each spots with a negative binomial or Poisson model. The method we use here, RCTD, uses the Poisson model, whose mean parameter weights the scRNA-seq cell type in each spot. Some of the methods impose a sparsity constraint on cell type assignment, as it's unlikely to get too many cell types per spot due to the limited number of cells that can fit into the spot.

There's also \"multi\" mode, which uses a greedy algorithm to find the number of cell types per spot (typically 3 or 4), though sometimes plausible cell types are excluded from the assignment.

Here LV cell types are often assigned to RV spots and vice versa, suggesting similarity between the LV and RV versions of each cell type and the lack of strong batch effect in the LV and RV scRNA-seq data. However, RV spots do tend to get a higher proportion of RV cell types. We also see that the valves have very disctinct cell type composition, where fibroblasts and TMSB4X high cells colocalize. The original paper of this dataset used cord plot to show cell type colocalization at the spots, which some of my colleagues find hard to read. Here we simply use a heatmap of the correlation matrix to show cell type colocalization."

For instance, ligand-receptor pair databases and data analysis methods that utilize such databases can infer interactions between cell types. However, this is difficult for this dataset because the best ligand-receptor pair databases are for human and mice. While it's possible to build a ligan-receptor pair database for chicken, it's too much for this tutorial. Furthermore, with datasets from different stages of development, a spatiotemporal analysis can be performed. However, traditional methods from spatiotemporal statistics can't be easily applied here because it's already a challenge to match tissue regions across developmental stages. However, with kallisto bustools, RNA velocity analyses can be performed across developmental stages, in additional to trajectory inference."
