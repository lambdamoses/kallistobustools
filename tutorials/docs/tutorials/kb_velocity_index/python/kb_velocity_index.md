## Build the index

`kb` automatically splits the genome into cDNA and intron FASTA files. Because Google Colab has limited memory, we need to split the index into parts (here, we use `-n 4`). This will reduce the maximum memory `kb` uses, but the runtime of `kb count` will increase, which is a fair tradeoff in favor of less memory.
